### FRONT-END  MIDDLE-END - BACK-END
- We need an intermediate layer between the client and the microservices.
- Using this middle end, when the client sends a request, we will able to make decisions that which microservice should actually respond to the request.
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting.
- We try to prepare an API gateway that acts as middle-end.
